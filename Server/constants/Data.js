        description: "Longlisted for the Women's Prize for Fiction 2023 ** In Stone Blind, the instant Sunday Times bestseller, Natalie Haynes brings the infamous Medusa to life as you have never seen her before. 'Witty, gripping, ruthless' - Margaret Atwood via Twitter 'Beautiful and moving' - Neil Gaiman via Twitter 'So to mortal men, we are monsters. Because of our flight, our strength. They fear us, so they call us monsters.' Medusa is the sole mortal in a family of gods. Growing up with her Gorgon sisters, she begins to realize that she is the only one who experiences change, the only one who can be hurt. And her mortal lifespan gives her an urgency that her family will never know. When the sea god Poseidon commits an unforgivable act in the temple of Athene, the goddess takes her revenge where she can - and Medusa is changed forever. Writhing snakes replace her hair, and her gaze now turns any living creature to stone. The power cannot be controlled: Medusa can look at nothing without destroying it. She is condemned to a life of shadows and darkness. Until Perseus embarks upon a quest to fetch the head of a Gorgon . . . Praise for Natalie Haynes, the Women's Prize-shortlisted author of A Thousand Ships: 'With her trademark passion, wit, and fierce feminism... her thoughtful portraits will linger with you long after the book is finished' - Madeline Miller, author of The Song of Achilles and Circe 'Haynes combines a wide-ranging knowledge of the original myths with a gift for compelling narrative' - The Times 'Natalie Haynes is both a witty and an erudite guide. She wears her extensive learning lightly and deftly drags the Classics into the modern world' - Kate Atkinson, author of Life After Life 'Haynes is master of her trade . . . She succeeds in breathing warm life into some of our oldest stories' - Telegraph 'Haynes is the nation's greatest muse' - Adam Rutherford",

In New York City, two rival witch families fight for the upper hand. The Antonova sisters are beautiful, cunning and ruthless, and their mother - known only as Baba Yaga - is the elusive supplier of premium intoxicants. Their adversaries, the influential Fedorov brothers, serve their crime boss father. Named Koschei the Deathless, his enterprise dominates the shadows of magical Manhattan. For twelve years, the families have maintained a fraught stalemate. Then everything is thrown into disarray. Bad blood carries them to the brink of disaster, even as fate draws together a brother and sister from either side. Yet the siblings still struggle for power, and internal conflicts could destroy each family from within. That is, if the enmity between empires doesn't destroy both sides first.",

However, on his eleventh birthday, Harry discovers a startling secret. He is not ordinary, and his parents didn’t die in an accident: they were murdered by a Dark Wizard who tried to murder Harry too, and failed. Harry is offered a place at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and he journeys to the magical castle where he makes friends for life. However, Hogwarts is a dangerous place, and there are secrets at every turn. The Dark Wizard who tried to murder Harry is still alive, and he’s waiting for a chance to return and wreak havoc once again. His first objective will be the death of Harry Potter. Let the magical experience come to life with the complete collection of books featuring Harry and his friends.`,
